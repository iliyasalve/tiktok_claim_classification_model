# Claim Classification Model for TikTok

## Description

This project was developed for TikTok with the aim of creating a predictive model capable of determining whether a video contains a claim or expresses an opinion. The main goal of the project is to reduce the number of user reports requiring manual moderation and improve the processing efficiency.

## Goals

- Develop a predictive model for classifying videos with claims;
- Reduce the backlog of user reports;
- Optimize the content moderation process.

## Stages

1. Project Proposal: Planning tasks and PACE strategies;
2. Dataframe Creation: Structuring data for analysis;
3. Data Analysis: Conducting exploratory analysis and visualization;
4. Hypothesis Testing: Determining the optimal method for testing;
5. Regression Model: Developing an appropriate regression model;
6. Final Model: Data processing, model development, and evaluation.

## Implementation
All code is written in Python. The code was developed in the Jupyter Notebook development environment.

## Conclusion
The developed model effectively classifies videos with claims, contributing to the reduction of the user report queue and improving the efficiency of the moderators.
